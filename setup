  Adapter 1 - WAN-Bridged adapter take note of the last few letters of the mac address eg 83
  Adapter 2 - LAN- HOstonly 66
--explanation
  why do we need two adapters?
  +the bridged adpater hooks the vms straight to the network, it grabs an IP from your LANâ€™s DHCP or static         pool,   letting OPNsense act like a legit device on your network, it gives the vm internal and external          network access    allowing it to route traffic, traffic analysis straight from the network.
  +hostonly creates a virtual network btwn host and vm..no external network access(safety), it lets us simulate     internal traffic without f'ing with the real network.
